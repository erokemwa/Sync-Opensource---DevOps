This is a simple program in which a user is presented with TV show choices and selects their preferences.
Selection must be either one or two, failure to which the program asks for output again.
The output is random based on the arrays. 
The code may be improved by:
1. The first execution prints two lines instead of one. Subsequent executions (after pressing Enter print only one line).
2. Once a show is randomly recommended it should not be repeated.
3. Once the user selects three invalid options at first, the program should exit
4. Should pointers be used in the array to save memory? (i.e., *s11[][] instead of s*[][20] )
5. The pool of selection may also be increased. 

Feel free to play around with the code.
